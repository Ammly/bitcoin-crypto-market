## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All 6 questions should be answerable:

| #   | Question                          | Can Answer?                 |
| --- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1   | How did historical prices change? | ‚úÖ Yes - Price Trends chart  |
| 2   | How big is Bitcoin vs others?     | ‚úÖ Yes - Dominance chart     |
| 3   | What will future prices be?       | ‚úÖ Yes - Predictions chart   |
| 4   | Which cryptos are volatile?       | ‚úÖ Yes - Volatility chart    |
| 5   | How do prices correlate?          | ‚úÖ Yes - Correlation heatmap |
| 6   | Are there seasonal patterns?      | ‚úÖ Yes - Seasonal charts     |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Charts Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify data import was successful
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running: `docker ps`
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### "Insufficient data" errors for Predictions
- Predictions require 200+ days of historical data
- Make sure you imported CSV files with enough history

### Seasonal patterns show "insufficient data"
- Seasonal analysis requires 730 days (2 years) by default
- Try a cryptocurrency with longer history (Bitcoin, Ethereum)

### API 500 errors
- Check terminal for server errors
- Verify database connection in `.env.local`
- Check database has data: `docker exec -it crypto_postgres psql -U crypto_user -d crypto_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM price_history;"`

---

## üìù Notes

- **Time periods:** All charts respect the time period selector (30d/90d/180d/1y/2y)
- **Performance:** First load may be slow while React Query caches data
- **Caching:** Subsequent loads should be much faster due to caching
- **Real-time:** This version uses historical data only (no live price feeds)

## üéâ You're Done!

If all tests pass, congratulations! Your cryptocurrency analysis platform is fully functional and ready to answer all 6 key analysis questions from a single dashboard interface.
