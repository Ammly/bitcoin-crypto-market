## Time Management Strategy

### If Running Behind Schedule

**With 6 hours left:**
- Focus ONLY on critical tasks (🔴)
- Skip optional analyses
- Use simpler models (Linear Regression only)
- Limit to 3-4 cryptocurrencies
- Create essential visualizations only
- Simplify presentation

**With 3 hours left:**
- Finish current analysis section
- Skip predictive modeling complexity (use baseline only)
- Focus on documentation and presentation
- Ensure code runs without errors
- Prepare 5-minute presentation

**With 1 hour left:**
- Stop coding new features
- Focus 100% on presentation
- Test demo thoroughly
- Create backup static slides
- Practice pitch

### If Ahead of Schedule

**Extra time available:**
1. Add more cryptocurrencies to analysis
2. Implement advanced models (LSTM, Prophet)
3. Create interactive dashboard
4. Perform sensitivity analysis
5. Add statistical significance tests
6. Create animated visualizations
7. Write detailed blog post
8. Deploy dashboard online

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Memory error when loading large datasets
- **Solution**: Load data in chunks, use `dtype` optimization, process one currency at a time

**Issue**: Plots not displaying in notebook
- **Solution**: Add `%matplotlib inline`, check for errors, restart kernel

**Issue**: Model taking too long to train
- **Solution**: Reduce data size, use simpler model, reduce hyperparameter search space

**Issue**: Correlation matrix shows all 1.0s
- **Solution**: Check if using price levels (use returns instead), verify different currencies loaded

**Issue**: Predictions are all the same value
- **Solution**: Check data scaling, verify target variable has variance, check for data leakage

**Issue**: Seasonal decomposition fails
- **Solution**: Ensure enough data points, check for NaN values, try different period parameter

**Issue**: Git push fails (file too large)
- **Solution**: Add large files to `.gitignore`, use Git LFS, or store data externally

**Issue**: Notebook kernel crashes
- **Solution**: Restart kernel, reduce data in memory, check for infinite loops

**Issue**: Visualizations look messy
- **Solution**: Adjust figure size, reduce number of elements, use subplots, improve color scheme
